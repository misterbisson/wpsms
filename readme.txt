A plugin to send SMS messages from other plugins. As easy to use as wp_mail().

== Description ==

An easy to use PHP class to send SMS messages. Does nothing on its own, but an implementation of it can be seen at <a href="http://library.plymouth.edu/read/222334">my University's library</a>, where they've used both <a href="http://about.scriblio.net/">Scriblio</a> and wpSMS to <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/12094/scriblio-feature-text-this-to-me/">allow visitors to text information about a book to their cellies</a>.

The plugin is aimed at developers, so the best documentation is in the code, though there is <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/projects/wpsms/">a quick introduction and some screenshts of it in action available here</a>.
